"""
In a given grid of 0s and 1s, we have some starting row and column sr, sc and a target row and column tr, tc. 
Return the length of the shortest path from sr, sc to tr, tc that walks along 1 values only.
Each location in the path, including the start and the end, must be a 1. Each subsequent location in the path must be 
4-directionally adjacent to the previous location.
It is guaranteed that grid[sr][sc] = grid[tr][tc] = 1, and the starting and target positions are different.
If the task is impossible, return -1.

Examples:
input:
grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
sr = 0, sc = 0, tr = 2, tc = 0
output: 8
(The lines below represent this grid:)

grid = [[1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1]]
sr = 0, sc = 0, tr = 2, tc = 0
output: -1

Constraints:
[time limit] 5000ms
[input] array.array.integer grid
1 â‰¤ arr.length = arr[i].length â‰¤ 10
[input] integer sr
[input] integer sc
[input] integer tr
[input] integer tc
All sr, sc, tr, tc are valid locations in the grid, grid[sr][sc] = grid[tr][tc] = 1, and (sr, sc) != (tr, tc).
